## Practicing Building a Website

I'm a brand new post and can be about anything you want. Try playing around with lists, links, images, and etc., and reference the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/mnyrop/nycdh-jekyll/blob/master/docs/markdown-cheatsheet.md) whenever you get stuck.
~~This is kind of scary.~~~
**But it's also really cool.**
_Who knew?_
1.  PhD programs should incorporate workshops like this into their prof dev. programs
2.  It would be particularly useful for creating personal websites/grad conferences
  a.I think this will let me make a sublist.
  b.Did it work?
3.  I could pitch this to the History dept. as a pilot
